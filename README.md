# **MILITARY AIRCRAFT DETECTION USING YOLOv11**

This project focuses on military aircraft detection using a deep learning model trained with the YOLOv11 framework. The goal is to identify different types of fighter jets, helicopters, and other transport vehicles. The model can classify 77 different types of aircraft and was trained using a robust dataset comprising over 14,200 annotated images, ensuring high accuracy in detection and classification tasks.

Each image was annotated, and YOLO label (.txt) files were generated manually using the labels_with_split.csv file provided with the dataset. The model can be deployed on a local machine using a Flask-based backend server (app.py) and a user-friendly web interface (index.html) for seamless interaction and real-time aircraft detection.
